Safety & Rescue App
Overview
This app is designed to provide a critical safety net, especially for individuals who may be prone to health emergencies or isolated situations. By connecting to a heart rate sensor, the app continuously monitors a user's vitals and can trigger an immediate SOS alert to emergency services if necessary.
Key Features:
 * Real-time Heart Rate Monitoring: Accurately tracks and displays heart rate data within the app.
 * SOS Alert System: Automatically sends an SMS to designated emergency contacts (police and hospital) if the heart rate falls below a predefined threshold or exceeds a critical limit.
 * User Information & Location: Includes the user's name, contact details, and current location (if enabled) in the SOS message for swift response.
How it Works:
 * Sensor Connection: Pair the app with a compatible heart rate sensor via Bluetooth or other wireless technology.
 * Heart Rate Monitoring: The app continuously receives and processes heart rate data from the sensor.
 * SOS Trigger: If the heart rate deviates significantly from the set parameters, an SOS alert is immediately initiated.
 * Emergency Contact Notification: The SOS message contains essential user information and location, enabling rapid assistance from emergency services.
Installation & Usage:
 * Download & Install: Obtain the app from the relevant app store (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
 * Sensor Pairing: Connect the heart rate sensor to the app following the provided instructions.
 * Set Emergency Contacts: Add the phone numbers of your desired emergency contacts (police and hospital).
 * Monitor Heart Rate: Keep the app running in the background to ensure continuous heart rate monitoring.
Note: For optimal functionality, ensure the heart rate sensor is properly calibrated and worn correctly. Always test the SOS alert system in a controlled environment to familiarize yourself with its operation.
Future Enhancements:
 * Additional Sensor Integration: Explore incorporating other health sensors (e.g., blood pressure, oxygen saturation) for more comprehensive monitoring.
 * Geofencing: Implement geofencing to trigger alerts based on location-specific conditions (e.g., entering a hazardous area).
 * Emergency Call Functionality: Integrate direct calling to emergency services for faster response times.
